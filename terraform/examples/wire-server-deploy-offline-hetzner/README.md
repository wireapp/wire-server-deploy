# Wire-server-deploy-offline-hetzner

This environment is set up and destroyed on demand to test our offline story,
and to function as a reference network diagram for an offline deploy

This is almost identical to the `wire` environment. We should probably reuse some code.
I just needed some boxes to test the offline deploy path on-demand.
