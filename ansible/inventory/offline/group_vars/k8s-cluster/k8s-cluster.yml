# Kubernetes cluster configuration for offline deployment

# This file contains configuration overrides for the Kubernetes cluster

# ==============================================================================
# kube-vip Configuration for High Availability Control Plane
# ==============================================================================
#
# kube-vip provides a Virtual IP (VIP) for the Kubernetes API server,
# enabling automatic failover between control plane nodes without requiring
# external load balancers. Perfect for bare-metal and air-gapped deployments.
#
# Documentation: docs/kube-vip-ha-setup.md
# Reference: https://kube-vip.io/

# Enable kube-vip
kube_vip_enabled: true

# Enable control plane VIP (required for HA)
kube_vip_controlplane_enabled: true

# Virtual IP address for the Kubernetes API server
# IMPORTANT: This must be:
#   - In the same subnet as your control plane nodes
#   - Unused and not in DHCP range
#   - Accessible from all nodes and external clients
# Example: If control plane nodes are 192.168.122.21-23, use 192.168.122.100
kube_vip_address: "192.168.122.100"

# Network interface to bind the VIP to
# Find this by running: ssh kubenode1 "ip -br addr show"
# Example values: eth0, enp1s0
kube_vip_interface: "enp1s0"

# Use ARP for Layer 2 VIP management (recommended for most deployments)
# Set to false only if using BGP for Layer 3 routing
kube_vip_arp_enabled: true

# Enable kube-vip for LoadBalancer services (optional)
# Set to true if you want kube-vip to also handle LoadBalancer service IPs
# For control plane HA only, keep this false
kube_vip_services_enabled: false

# API server advertise address (use VIP for consistency)
# This is the address the API server advertises to clients
apiserver_loadbalancer_domain_name: "192.168.122.100"

# Required for kube-vip with ARP mode
# Prevents kube-proxy from responding to ARP requests for the VIP
kube_proxy_strict_arp: true

# Configure API server endpoint to use VIP
# This tells all Kubernetes components to connect via the VIP
loadbalancer_apiserver:
  address: "192.168.122.100"
  port: 6443

# Disable localhost load balancer since we have VIP
# When using kube-vip, we don't need the nginx localhost proxy
loadbalancer_apiserver_localhost: false

# Add VIP to API server SSL certificates
# This ensures the API server certificate is valid for the VIP address
supplementary_addresses_in_ssl_keys:
  - "192.168.122.100"
