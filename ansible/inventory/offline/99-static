## In the next three sections, Cassandra, elasticsearch, and MinIO need
#  the name of the interface you want database services to run on
#  specified. While this can be used to specify a private network just
#  for databases, you must specify the interface name you want to run
#  services on, even in the case that it is the only interface on the box.

# Note: for offline configurations, this is required. the impact is that dns
# on the physical kubenodes does not perform requests against the kubernetes
# cluster, prefering the network provided DNS settings.
