# This playbook helps you check if ntp has been properly setup on the host that Cassandra
# is running on. Verifies that the daemon is running and that there is no more than
# `allowed_time_diff_between_servers_in_ms` diff between all servers
#
# NOTE: This playbook has been tested on Ubuntu and using ansible2.7
# TODO: Adjust this to be run on _ALL_ hosts in the inventory
