# If you want to use TLS termination on the ingress,
# then set this variable to true and ensure that there
# is a valid wildcard TLS certificate
# When TLS is enable, ensure that you have the certificate
# and secret in a file under helm_vars/bare/secret.yaml (or
# another location) since enabling TLS requires you to supply
# a `tlsWildcardCert` and `tlsWildcardKey` (these will then be
# 64 encoded as part of the secret creation) so those values
# should simply contain the certificate and key (you can also
# encrypt them with sops and use helm-wrapper, check README.md
# for an example)
