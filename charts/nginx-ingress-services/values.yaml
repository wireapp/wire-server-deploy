# Default values for nginx-ingress-services

# Team settings and account pages are disabled by default since they
# require access to a private repo.
teamSettings:
  enabled: false
accountPages:
  enabled: false

# If you want to use TLS termination on the ingress,
# then set this variable to true and ensure that there
# is a valid wildcard TLS certificate
# When TLS is enable, ensure that you have the certificate
# and secret in a file under helm_vars/bare/secret.yaml (or
# another location) since enabling TLS requires you to supply
# a `tlsWildcardCert` and `tlsWildcardKey` (these will then be
# 64 encoded as part of the secret creation) so those values
# should simply contain the certificate and key (you can also
# encrypt them with sops and use helm-wrapper, check README.md
# for an example)
tls:
  enabled: true

# For TLS
# secrets:
#     tlsWildcardCert: |
#         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
#         -----END CERTIFICATE-----

# For Services:
# service:
#   s3:
#     externallyCreated: true
#     ^ externallyCreated might be useful if S3 access is provided by
#       an external service such as `minio-external`: in such cases
#       we do not want to create yet another service here but rather
#       use that service instead in the ingress
#     serviceName: minio-external
