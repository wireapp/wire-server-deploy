# Normally, NodePort will listen to traffic on all nodes, and uses
# kube-proxy to redirect to the node that actually runs
# nginx-ingress-controller. However one problem with this is that this
# traffic is NAT'ed. This means that nginx will not have access to the
# source IP address from which the request originated.  We want to have
# this source IP address for potentially logging and rate-limiting based on
# it. By setting externalTrafficPolicy: local,  nodes will no longer
# forward requests to other nodes if they receive a request that they
# themselves can not handle. Upside is that the traffic is now not NAT'ed
# anymore, and we get access to the source IP address. Downside is that you
# need to know beforehand which nodes run a certain pod. However, with
# kubernetes a pod can be rescheduled to any node at any time so we can not
# trust this.  We could do something with node affinities to decide apriori
# on what set of nodes will be publicly reachable and make sure the nginx
# controller pods are only ran on there but for now that sounds a bit
# overkill. Instead, we just simply run the ingress controller on each node
# using a daemonset. This means that any node in the cluster can receive
# requests and redirect them to the correct service, whilst maintaining the
# source ip address.  The ingress controller is sort of taking over the
# role of what kube-proxy was doing before.
