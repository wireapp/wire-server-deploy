# NEXT

A new mandatory option has been introduced to
`brig` and `galley` which in the future will be used for Wire federation.  This domain name
is *not* optional even if federation is not used.

Please update your `values/wire-server/values.yaml` to set `brig.optSettings.setFederationDomain`
and `galley.settings.federationDomain` (Note the slightly different option name).

## Update instructions

The redis chart that we updated to exposes the redis service as
`redis-ephemeral-master` instead of `redis-ephemeral`.

**You should update your `values/wire-server/values.yaml` to point gundeck to the new service name**
```diff
       redis:
-        host: redis-ephemeral
+        host: redis-ephemeral-master
```

If a gundeck crashes whilst deploying this release, it might not be able to
reconnect to redis until the release is fully rolled out. However this risk is
small.


### If you installed the `wire/redis-ephemeral` chart directly:

```
helm upgrade redis-ephemeral wire/redis-ephemeral -f <values>
helm upgrade wire-server wire/wire-server -f <values>
```

### If you installed the `wire/databases-ephemeral` chart:

```
helm upgrade databases-ephemeral wire/databases-ephemeral -f <values>
helm upgrade wire-server wire/wire-server -f  <values>
```
