# Scope

This document gives exact instructions for performing an offline installation of Wire on a single VM from Hetzner. it uses the KVM based virtual machine system to create all of the required virtual machines.

This document also gives instructions for creating a TURN calling server on a separate VM.

## Use the hetzner robot console to create a new server.

Select Ubuntu 22.04.2 on an ax101 dedicated server.

If not using Hetzner, for reference, the specs of the ax101 server are:

- AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 9 5950X
- 128 GB DDR4 ECC RAM
- 2 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD Datacenter Edition (software RAID 1)
- 1 GBit/s port

In our example, the returned IP when creating the server was: 65.21.197.76

## Pre-requisites

First off, generate a ssh key if you do not have one already.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

## tighten security.

### log in as root.

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@65.21.197.76 -o serveraliveinterval=60
```

### update OS

When prompted about the ssh config, just accept the maintainer's version.

```
apt update
apt upgrade -y
```

### Install tmate

Tmate is a terminal sharing service, which you might need in order for more than one person to collaborate on solving issues, Wire might ask you for a tmate session when debugging any problem you encounter.

```
sudo apt install tmate
```

If asked, to start a tmate session, you would simply then do:

```
tmate
```

And copy/paste the links that are generated, which would then result in the terminal session being shared with whomever you shared the links with.

### Reboot

reboot to load a new, patched kernel.

```
reboot
```

### Disable password login for sshd

Install `nano` or your favorite text editor:

```
sudo apt install nano -y
```

Make sure the following values are configured in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

```
# this is the important value
PasswordAuthentication no

# make sure PAM and Challenge Response is also disabled
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM no

# don't allow root to login via password
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
```

Alternatively you can use these commands:

```
sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/UsePAM yes/ChallengeResponseAuthentication no\nUsePAM no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### re-start SSH

```
service ssh restart
```

### Install fail2ban

```
apt install fail2ban -y
```

## Create demo user.

### create our 'demo' user

```
adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" demo
```

### copy ssh key to demo user

```
mkdir ~demo/.ssh
cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/demo/.ssh/
chown demo.demo ~demo/.ssh/
chown demo.demo ~demo/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### add a configuration for demo not to need a password in order to SUDO.

```
echo "demo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/10-demo_user
chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/10-demo_user
```

## ssh in as demo user.

on the remote machine:

```
logout
```

on the local machine:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 demo@65.21.197.76 -o serveraliveinterval=60
```

## Disable root login via ssh

Use sudo to edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

And set the following:

```
# even better: don't allow to login as root via ssh at all
PermitRootLogin no
```

Or use this command:

```
sudo sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### re-start SSH

```
sudo service ssh restart
```

### Install screen

```
sudo apt install screen
```

### Start a screen session

```
screen
```

### download offline artifact.

Use the HASH provided by the wire

```
wget https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/public.wire.com/artifacts/wire-server-deploy-static-<HASH>.tgz
```

### extract offline artifact.

```
mkdir wire-server-deploy
cd wire-server-deploy
tar -xzf ../wire-server-deploy-static-*.tgz
```

### extract debian archive

We'll use the docker that is in the archive.


For Ubuntu 22.04:

```
tar -xf debs-jammy.tar
```

### (FIXME: add iptables to the repo) Install Docker from debian archive.

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

apt -y install iptables;
dpkg -i debs-jammy/public/pool/main/d/docker-ce/docker-ce-cli_*.deb;
dpkg -i debs-jammy/public/pool/main/c/containerd.io/containerd.io_*.deb;
dpkg -i debs-jammy/public/pool/main/d/docker-ce/docker-ce_*.deb;
dpkg --configure -a;
'
```

### (missing) point host OS to debian archive

### (rewrite) Install networking tools

We're going to install dnsmasq in order to provide DNS to virtual machines, and DHCP to virtual machines. networking will be handled by ufw.

Note that dnsmasq always fails when it installs. the failures (red stuff) is normal.

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

systemctl disable systemd-resolved;
apt install dnsmasq ufw -y;
systemctl stop systemd-resolved;
'
```

### Tell dnsmasq to provide DNS locally.

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

echo "listen-address=127.0.0.53
no-resolv
server=8.8.8.8
" > /etc/dnsmasq.d/00-lo-systemd-resolvconf;
service dnsmasq restart;
'
```

### Configure Firewall

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

ufw allow 22/tcp;
ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/24 proto udp to any port 53;
ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/24 proto tcp to any port 3003;
ufw allow from 127.0.0.0/24 proto udp to any port 53;
ufw allow in on br0 from any proto udp to any port 67;
ufw allow Openssh;
ufw enable;
'
```

### Install libvirt and dependencies

We will install libvirt to create the vms for deployment

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm qemu-utils libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system virtinst bridge-utils virt-manager;
systemctl enable libvirtd;
systemctl start libvirtd;
'
```

### add the demo user to the kvm and docker group

```
sudo usermod -a -G kvm -G docker demo
```

### log out, log back in, and return to Wire-Server.

you have to exit screen, and logout

```
exit
logout
```

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 demo@65.21.197.76 -o serveraliveinterval=60
cd wire-server-deploy/
screen
```

### install bridge-utils

So that we can manage the virtual network.

```
sudo apt install bridge-utils net-tools -y
```

### (personal) install emacs

```
sudo apt install emacs-nox -y
```

### (temporary) manually create bridge device.

This is the interface we are going to use to talk to the virtual machines.

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

brctl addbr br0;
ifconfig br0 172.16.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up;
'
```

### tell DnsMasq to provide DHCP to our KVM VMs.

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

echo "listen-address=172.16.0.1
dhcp-range=172.16.0.2,172.16.0.127,10m
" > /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-br0-dhcp;
service dnsmasq restart;
'
```

### enable ip forwarding.

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

sed -i "s/.*net.ipv4.ip_forward.*/net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/" /etc/sysctl.conf;
sysctl -p;
'
```

### Enable network masquerading

To prepare determine the interface of your outbound IP:

```
export OUTBOUNDINTERFACE=$(ip ro | sed -n "/default/s/.* dev \([en\(ps|o)0-9]*\) .*/\1/p")
echo OUTBOUNDINTERFACE is $OUTBOUNDINTERFACE
```

Please Check that `OUTBOUNDINTERFACE` is correctly set, before running enabling network masquerading:

```
sudo bash -c "
set -eo pipefail;

sed -i 's/.*DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=.*/DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"/' /etc/default/ufw;
sed -i \"1i *nat\n:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n-A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/24 -o $OUTBOUNDINTERFACE -j MASQUERADE\nCOMMIT\" /etc/ufw/before.rules;
service ufw restart;
"
```

### Add static IPs for VMs.

```
sudo bash -c '
set -eo pipefail;

echo "
dhcp-host=assethost,172.16.0.128,10h
dhcp-host=kubenode1,172.16.0.129,10h
dhcp-host=kubenode2,172.16.0.130,10h
dhcp-host=kubenode3,172.16.0.131,10h
dhcp-host=ansnode1,172.16.0.132,10h
dhcp-host=ansnode2,172.16.0.133,10h
dhcp-host=ansnode3,172.16.0.134,10h
" > /etc/dnsmasq.d/20-hosts;
service dnsmasq restart;
'
```

### Acquire ubuntu 22.04 server installation CD (server).

```
curl https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso -o ubuntu.iso
sudo setfacl -m u:libvirt-qemu:--x /home/demo
```

## Create 7 vms for deployment

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/kvm/images/ # place to store the drive images for vms
```

Create a separate window with screen (Ctrl+A C) and run
```
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh serve_nocloud
```
This starts a web server on port 3003 to serve no_cloud configuration files for the automated VM installation process. Leave this running until you have created all the VMS.  Switch back to your previous screen window (Ctrl+A N).

Pick a username and password for the default non-root user that will be created on all VMS.
```
export OFFLINE_USERNAME=demo # feel free to change this
export OFFLINE_PASSWORD=$(mkpasswd) # this fill prompt you for a password
```

Create VMS in parallel and start the automatic ubuntu installation process
```
# run these commands one after the other
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh create_assethost assethost
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh create_node kubenode1
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh create_node kubenode2
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh create_node kubenode3
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh create_node ansnode1
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh create_node ansnode2
./bin/offline-vm-setup.sh create_node ansnode3
```

This can take a while. While the installation is running check the state of all VMS by running`sudo virsh list --all`.  You can attach a console via `sudo virsh console ansnode1` to obvserve the installation progress (Ctrl+5 to detach the console).  After the installation completed the state of of each vm should be listed as `shut off`.

Run
```
sudo virsh list --all
```
and check that every VM has completed installation, i.e. it is in `shut off` state.
Start all VMS

```
sudo bash -c "
set -e;
virsh start assethost;
virsh start kubenode1;
virsh start kubenode2;
virsh start kubenode3;
virsh start ansnode1;
virsh start ansnode2;
virsh start ansnode3;
"
```

Check for every VM that dnsmasq was assigned the correct IP adress. Compare with the corresponding entry in the file `20-hosts` (see above).
For example for VM `ansnode1` run this command:

```
cat /etc/dnsmasq.d/20-hosts 
ssh demo@ansnode1 ip a show enp1s0
```

Repeat this vor all VMs.

In case you had to destroy and recreate VMs the IP addresses might not match, because dnsmasq already has still leases for the previously created VMS.
In that case stop dnsmsq, manually remove the outdated leases from `/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases`, start dnsmasq, then reboot the VM.
 

## disable internet access to the vms

Replace all of ntftables.conf

```
sudo nano /etc/nftables.conf
```

With this content:

```
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

flush ruleset

table inet filter {
        chain input {
                type filter hook input priority 0;
        }
        chain forward {
                type filter  hook forward priority 0;
                policy accept;
                ct state {established, related} accept comment "allow tracked connections";
                iifname "br0" oifname "enp7s0" drop comment "Drop connections that VMs try to initiate with the internet";
        }
        chain output {
                type filter hook output priority 0;
        }
}
```

Then run:

```
sudo systemctl restart nftables
```

ssh into a vm and see if you can access the internet -

```
ping 8.8.8.8
```

the above command shouldn't receive the packets,
in case internet is working than - restart libvirt from host machine

```
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
```

ssh into each vm and reboot them

and check again, until internet is disabled on the vms.

In rare case, if we want to enable internet access on the vms for some test related purpose,
comment the line -- iifname "br0" oifname "enp7s0" drop comment "Drop connections that VMs try to initiate with the internet";
from nftables.conf and restart these services

```
sudo systemctl restart nftables libvirtd systemd-machined qemu-kvm.service ufw
```

#### install turn pointing to port 8080

### manage VMs

You can use the `virsh` command to manage the virtual machines (start, stop, list them etc).

Get help:

```
virsh help
```

Connect to `kubenode1` already running in the background.

```
sudo virsh console kubenode1
```

List VMs:

```
sudo virsh list --all
```

### From this point:

switch to docs_ubuntu_22.04.md.
