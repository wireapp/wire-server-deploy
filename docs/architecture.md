## Restund (TURN) servers

### Introduction

Restund servers allow two users on different private networks (for example Alice who is in an office connected to an office router and Bob who is at home connected to a home router) to have a Wire audio or video call. More precisely:

> Restund is a modular and flexible [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) and [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) Server, with IPv4 and IPv6 support.

### Architecture

Since the restund servers help establishing a connection between two users, they need to be reachable by both of these users, which usually means they need to have a **public IP address**.

While one server is enough to get started, two servers provide high-availability in case one server gets into trouble.

You can either have restund servers directly exposed to the public internet:

Or you can have them reachable by fronting them with a firewall or load balancer machine that may have a different IP than the server where restund is installed:

### Protocols and open ports

#### UDP

Restund servers provide the best audio/video connections if end-user devices can connect to them via UDP. In this case, a firewall (if any) needs to allow and/or forward the complete UDP port range `1024-65535` for incoming UDP traffic. Port `3478` is the default control port, however one UDP port per active connection is required, so a whole port range must be available and reachable from the outside.

In case e.g. office firewall rules disallow UDP traffic, there is a possibility to use TCP instead, at the expense of call quality.

#### TCP

Two (configurable) ports are used by restund for TCP, one for plain TCP and one for TLS. By default restund uses ports `3478` for plain TCP and port `5349` for TLS. You can instead use (if that's easier with firewall rules) for example ports `80` and `443` (requires to run restund as root) or do a redirect from a load balancer (if using one) to redirect `443 -> 5349` and `80 -> 3478`.

### Amount of users and filedescriptors

Each allocation (active connection by one participant) requires 1 or 2 file descriptors, so ensure you increase your file descriptor limits in case you have many users.

Currently one restund server can have a maximum of 64000 allocations. If you have more users than that in an active call, you need to deploy more restund servers.

### Load balancing and high-availability

Load balancing is not possible, since STUN/TURN is a stateful protocol, so UDP packets addressed to `restund server 1`, if by means of a load balancer were to end up at `restund server 2`, would get dropped, as the second server doesn't know the source address.

High-availability is nevertheless ensured by having and advertising more than one restund server.

### Discovery and establishing a call

A simplified flow of how restund servers, along with the wire-server are used to establish a call:

### DNS

Usually DNS records are used which point to the public IPs of the restund servers (or of the respective firewall or load balancer machines). These DNS names are then used when configuring wire-server.
