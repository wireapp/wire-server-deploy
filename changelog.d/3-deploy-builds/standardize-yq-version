Changed: Standardized all scripts to use yq-go (v4+) for YAML processing, replacing deprecated python-yq. Updated syntax in offline deployment scripts (cd.sh, cd-with-retry.sh), build scripts (build_adminhost_containers.sh), demo deployment (offline_deploy_k8s.sh), secret sync utilities, and chart image extraction. This fixes CI build errors with helm template YAML parsing and ensures consistent, reliable YAML manipulation across the codebase.
