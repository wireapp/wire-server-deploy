## Introduction

This repository contains the code and configuration to deploy [wire-server](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server) and [wire-webapp](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp), as well as dependent components, such as cassandra databases. To allow a maximum of flexibility with respect to where wire-server can be deployed (e.g. with cloud providers like AWS, on bare-metal servers, etc), we chose [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) as the target platform.
