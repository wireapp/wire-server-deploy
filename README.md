## Introduction

This repository contains code and documentation on how to deploy [wire-server](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server). To allow a maximum of flexibility with respect to where wire-server can be deployed (e.g. with cloud providers like AWS, on bare-metal servers, etc), we chose [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) as the target platform.

This means you first need to install a kubernetes cluster, and then deploy wire-server onto that kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

As a minimum for a demo installation, you need:

* a **Kubernetes cluster** with enough resources. There are [many different options](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/). A tiny subset of those solutions we tried include:
    * if using AWS, you may want to look at:
        * [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (if you're okay having all your data in one of the EKS-supported US regions)
        * [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
    * if using regular physical or virtual servers:
        * [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray)
* a **Domain Name** under your control and the ability to set DNS entries
* the ability to generate **SSL certificates** for that domain name
    * you could use e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

### Required server resources

* For an ephemeral in-memory demo-setup
    * a single server with 8 CPU cores, 32GB of memory, and 20GB of disk space is sufficient.
* For a production setup, you need at least 3 servers. For an optimal setup, more servers are required, it depends on your environment.

## Contents of this repository

* `bin/` - some helper bash scripts
* `charts/` - so-called "[helm](https://www.helm.sh/) charts" - templated kubernetes configuration in YAML
* `docs/` - further documentation
* `values/` - example override values to helm charts

## Development setup

You need to install

* [helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) (v2.11.x is known to work)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (v1.12.x is known to work)

and you need to configure access to a kubernetes cluster (minimum v1.9+, 1.12+ recommended).

Optionally, if working in a team and you'd like to share `secrets.yaml` files between developers using a private git repository and encrypted files, you may wish to install

* [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops)
* [helm-secrets plugin](https://github.com/futuresimple/helm-secrets)

## Installing wire-server

### Demo installation

* AWS account not required
* Requires only a kubernetes cluster

The demo setup is the easiest way to install a functional wire-server with limitations (such as no persistent storage, no high-availability, missing features). For the purposes of this demo, we assume you **do not have an AWS account**. Try this demo first before trying to configure a more complicated setup involving persistence and higher availability.

*For all the following `helm upgrade` commands, it can be useful to run a second terminal with `kubectl --namespace demo get pods -w` to see what's happening.*

#### Install non-persistent, non-highly-available databases

*Please note that this setup is for demonstration purposes; no data is ever written to disk, so a restart will wipe data. Even without restarts expect it to be unstable: you may experience total service unavailability and/or **total data loss after a few hours/days** due to the way kubernetes and cassandra [interact](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/28969). For more information on this see the production installation section.*

The following will install (or upgrade) 3 single-pod databases and 3 ClusterIP services to reach them:

- **databases-ephemeral**
    - cassandra-ephemeral
    - elasticsearch-ephemeral
    - redis-ephemeral

```shell
./bin/update.sh databases-ephemeral # a recursive wrapper around 'helm dep update'
helm upgrade --install --namespace demo demo-databases-ephemeral charts/databases-ephemeral --wait
```

To delete: `helm delete --purge demo-databases-ephemeral`

#### Install AWS service mocks

The code in wire-server still depends on some AWS services for some of its functionality. To ensure wire-server services can correctly start up, install the following "fake" (limited-functionality, non-HA) aws services:

- **fake-aws**
    - fake-aws-sqs
    - fake-aws-sns
    - fake-aws-s3
    - fake-aws-dynamodb

```shell
./bin/update.sh fake-aws # a recursive wrapper around 'helm dep update'
helm upgrade --install --namespace demo demo-fake-aws charts/fake-aws --wait
```

To delete: `helm delete --purge demo-fake-aws`

#### Install a demo SMTP server

You can either install this very basic SMTP server, or configure your own (see SMTP options in [this section](docs/configuration.md#smtp-server))

```shell
helm upgrade --install --namespace demo demo-smtp charts/demo-smtp --wait
```

#### Install wire-server

- **wire-server**
    - cassandra-migrations
    - elasticsearch-index
    - galley
    - gundeck
    - brig
    - cannon
    - nginz
    - proxy (optional, disabled by default)
    - spar (optional, disabled by default)
    - webapp (optional, enabled by default)
    - team-settings (optional, disabled by default - requires access to a private repository)
    - account-pages (optional, disabled by default - requires access to a private repository)

Start by copying the necessary `values` and `secrets` configuration files:

```
cp values/wire-server/demo-values.example.yaml values/wire-server/demo-values.yaml
cp values/wire-server/demo-secrets.example.yaml values/wire-server/demo-secrets.yaml
```

In `values/wire-server/demo-values.yaml` (referred to as `values-file` below) and `values/wire-server/demo-secrets.yaml` (referred to as `secrets-file`), the following has to be adapted:

* turn server shared key (needed for audio/video calling)
    * Generate with e.g. `openssl rand -base64 64 | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc a-zA-Z0-9 | head -c 42` or similar
    * Add key to secrets-file under `brig.secrets.turn.secret`
    * (this will eventually need to be shared with a turn server, not part of this demo yet)
* zauth private/public keys (For authentication; `access tokens` and `user tokens` (cookies) are signed and validated with these)
    * Generate from within [wire-server](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server) with `./dist/zauth -m gen-keypair -i 1` if you have everything compiled; or alternatively with docker using `docker run --rm quay.io/wire/alpine-intermediate /dist/zauth -m gen-keypair -i 1`
    * add both to secrets-file under `brig.zauth` and the public one to secrets-file under `nginz.secrets.zAuth.publicKeys`
* domain names and urls
    * in your values-file, replace `example.com` and other domains and subdomains with domains of your choosing. Look for the `# change this` comments. You can try using `sed -i 's/example.com/<your-domain>/g' <values-file>`.

Update the chart dependencies:

```sh
./bin/update.sh wire-server
```

Try linting your chart, are any configuration values missing?

```sh
helm lint -f values/wire-server/demo-values.yaml -f values/wire-server/demo-secrets.yaml charts/wire-server
```

If you're confident in your configuration, try installing it:

```sh
helm upgrade --install --namespace demo demo-wire-server charts/wire-server \
    -f values/demo-values.yaml \
    -f values/demo-secrets.yaml \
    --wait
```

#### Adding a load balancer, DNS, and SSL termination

* If you're on bare metal or on a cloud provider without external load balancer support, see [configuring a load balancer on bare metal servers](docs/configuration.md#load-balancer-on-bare-metal-servers)
* If you're on AWS or another cloud provider, see [configuring a load balancer on cloud provider](docs/configuration.md#load-balancer-on-cloud-provider)

#### Beyond the demo

For further configuration options (some have specific requirements about your environment), see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
